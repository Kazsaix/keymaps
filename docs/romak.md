## Romak

- Romak is the layout used in the default base layer. It is a Colemak-DH variant, improved to remove load from pinkies and for prose in Portuguese.
- Romak has a higher SFB rate than Colemak-DH, close to Workman, but most of this load goes to the stronger fingers.
- Compared to Colemak-DH, Romak changes A, W, R, S, F and C, on the left side, and I, O, Y, H and M, on the right side.
- There is a commented out transition path from Qwerty to Romak in the [keymap_blocks.h](../qmk/users/rafaelromao/definitions/keymap_blocks.h), similar to Tarmak, but moving _ instead of J.
