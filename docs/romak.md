- Romak is the layout used in the default base layer. It is a Colemak-DHm variant, improved to remove load from pinkies and for prose in Portuguese.
- Romak has a higher SFB rate than Colemak-DHm, close to Workman, but most of this load goes to the stronger fingers.
- Compared to Colemak-DHm, Romak cycle A, W and S, and inverts Y with O.
- Compared with Qwerty, it also changes the position of the symbols _ and ; the same way the Colemak-DHm layer does.
- There is a commented out transition path from Qwerty to Romak in the [keymap_blocks.h](../qmk/users/rafaelromao/definitions/keymap_blocks.h), similar to Tarmak, but moving _ instead of J.
