## Romak

- Romak is the layout used in the default base layer. It is inspired in [Colemak](https://colemak.org) and [BEAKL](https://ieants.cc/beakl), improved to remove load from pinkies and for typing in Portuguese.
- Romak has a higher SFB rate than Colemak, close to Workman, but most of this load goes to the stronger fingers.
- There is a commented out transition path from Qwerty to Romak in the [keymap_blocks.h](../qmk/users/rafaelromao/definitions/keymap_blocks.h), similar to Tarmak, but moving _ instead of J.
