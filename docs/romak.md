# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Romak

Romak is a new keyboard layout, inspired by [Colemak](https://colemak.org) and [BEAKL](https://ieants.cc/beakl), improved to remove load from pinkies and for typing in Portuguese and English.

- The name Romak is a combination of my last name, **Rom**Ã£o, and Dvor**ak**'s name.
- Romak assumes the right hand as dominant, puts vowels, H and R it the right hand, and has a lower SFB rate than Colemak, with most of the load on the stronger fingers.
- Romak is also designed to favor hand alternation more than rolls.

## Romak vs Colemak-DH
[Stevep99's Layout Analyzer Tool](https://stevep99.github.io/keyboard-layout-analyzer) was used to compare Romak with Colemak-DH and some other layouts, using the Magna Carta as text corpus, combining [Portuguese](analysis/corpus.pt.txt) and [English](analysis/corpus.en.txt).
### General Performance

### Finger Usage
Pinkies will get less load in Romak, by design.

### Detailed Finger Analysis
The [Colemak mod-DH analysis tool](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/analyze.html) was also used to compare Romak against Colemak-DH (English text corpus only).

## Extentions

- The [N-Grams and Accents](macros.md#n-grams-and-accents) layer extend the Romak base layer to give easy access to common English and Portuguese n-grams and Portuguese accentuated characters.
- The [Lower and Raise](symbols.md) layers give access to function keys, symbols and numbers. The symbols are arranged to make them easy to use in software programming, with VIM, and math operations.
