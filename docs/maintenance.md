# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Maintenance
The Maintenance layer is activated holding both outer thumb keys and allows us to:
- Put the keyboard in bootloader mode. 
- Reset the keyboard memory.
- Configure the RGB lights.
- Put the host computer in sleep mode, lock it or power it off.
- Change the operating system used in keys that are OS aware, like the [Default Mod key](modifiers.md).
  - Source code: [os_toggle.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/os_toggle.c)
