# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Maintenance
The Maintenance layer is activated holding both outer thumb keys and we have options like:
- Put the keyboard in bootloader mode (reset). 
- Clear the eeprom.
- Toggle RGB.
- Deactivate all layers and return to the base. 
- Put the host computer in sleep mode, or power it off.
- Change the operating system used in keys that are OS aware, like the [Default Mod key](modifiers.md).
  - Source code: [os_toggle.c](../src/qmk/users/rafaelromao/features/os_toggle.c)
- A combo with the four extreme corner keys puts the keyboard in bootloader mode. This combo is a base layer alternative for the Reset key, in the Maintenance layer, in case some unintended layer lock prevents access to it.
