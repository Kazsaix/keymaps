# rafaelromao's keyboard layout

## Layout Overview
- This is a 34 keys split layout, 3x5+2, optimized for programmers.
- This layout works well with the OS configured for the US International keyboard.
- This layout was designed mostly for coding and typing in English and Portuguese.
- This layout considers the right hand as the dominant hand.
- The base layer is [Romak](romak.md), a new keyboard layout, inspired by [Colemak](https://colemak.org) and [BEAKL](https://ieants.cc/beakl).

## Smart Thumb Keys
- The Smart Thumb keys in this layout change behavior according to the context (active layer and active modifiers).
- The four thumb keys control layer transitions, when held (navigation, lower, raise and media).
- The two outer thumb keys act as [modifiers](modifiers.md), when tapped.
- The two inner thumb keys act as space or backspace, when tapped (which is inverted in the [Macros](macros.md) layer).
- Holding both outer thumb keys will activate the maintenance layer.

## Base Layer Combos
- Combos are available in the base and [Numpad](symbols.md#numpad) layers to send ENTER, ESC, TAB, common shortcuts.
- Most combos include the home thumb key, the one in the same side, to avoid misfires.
- One-shot shift can be used to invert the [default modifier](modifiers.md) used in the combos.
- If shift, or any other modifier, is held, it will be included in the combo. So hold Shift and tap Z+X+Space will send Redo instead of Undo.

## Base Layer Macros
- Some macros are available directly from the base layer.

### Shift + Backspace for Delete.
- Delete is available in the Navigation layer, but tapping Backspace while holding Shift will also send Delete.

### Double Comma for Leader Key
- The Leader Key can be accessed double tapping the comma key. This allow really fast access to leader sequences.

### Double Dot for New Sentences
- A double tap in the dot key outputs dot followed by space, and activates one-shot shift. This will make it easier to enter a new sentence.
- Holding the dot key will insert it in the end of the current line.

### Pontuation Hold
- Holding a pontuation key (dot, comma or semicollon) will add it to the end of the current line.
